## Abstract

As engineering education evolves in response to the demands of Industry 5.0 and entrepreneurial university models, academic leaders face increasing pressure to design innovative pedagogical strategies that are both technically robust and human-centered. This study proposes an evaluation framework that supports educational leadership, aiming to assess the impact of learning strategies not only on knowledge acquisition but also on student well-being, agency, and developmental growth.

Drawing on the World Health Organization‚Äôs Quality of Life (WHOQOL) model, the framework categorizes student reflections into Quality of Life domains and thus captures students' holistic development from psychological, social, and autonomy-related aspects. A case study in a real engineering program execution illustrates the framework‚Äôs practical value. The framework is applied by comparing two learning methods and two reflection collection modalities, across a variety of project application domains, generating multidimensional insights into their educational and developmental outcomes.

Results indicate that project-based learning within a socially and cognitively diverse environment, combined with interview-based reflective assessment, fosters deeper personal and interpersonal engagement, supporting a broader educational mission. Furthermore, the project application domain may influence the effectiveness of the learning strategy. This paper contributes to education management strategic decision-making by presenting a data-driven, student-centered tool for evaluating pedagogical innovation, offering strategic guidance for educational leaders seeking to align learning strategy design with institutional transformation and future-ready competencies.

Replication & Adaptation

You are encouraged to replicate or adapt the framework for your own institutional setting. 

The data/ folder includes following files:

  Student statement csv file - Statement list generated by students in the case study undertaken during the execution of the Engineering study program at Juraj Dobrila University of Pula. For each student statement an Learning method / Collection Method / Application Domain used in the learning strategy where the statement is collected is defined.
  
  Raters csv files named as Rater_1, Rater_2, Rater_3 

  Rater description file txt file - a file that provides a list of all rates and their short description
  
  You are encouraged to contribute with your rater file following the name convention Rater_no and providing a short description of your expertise in the Rater description txt file.
