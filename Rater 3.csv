"Web applications are vulnerable and what we can do about it to protect from that. Some web application vulnerabilities are: authentication, XSS (cross-site scripting), DDoS, weak past.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Ethical"
"If the code is not well implemented, there may be problems with authentication. For example if the application stores passwords as plain text in the database without cryptography this increases the likelihood that someone who enters the database can log in as an admin and delete all data. To avoid such a problem, it is necessary to hash the password. It would also be desirable to use salting in addition to hashing also adds random characters. Some examples of hash algorithms are: SHA256, SHA512, etc.",Technical,"Technical, Ethical"
"In this case, the attacker stores the code (usually in Javascript) in the database where later renders that code using a web application. It means when a user visits the web page the code will start executing. In this way, we can access confidential user data data, i.e. one can steal a user's session and thus access it private data in the application even though we do not have its password. One of the simplest the method of protection against XSS attacks is to set the browser's security level to the highest level. This way no XSS code can be run.",Technical,"Technical, Ethical"
"A DDoS attack occurs when an attacker sends a lot of requests to a server with the aim of overload the page or shut down completely. These attacks can last for days, or even longer. 2DDoS can be prevented in several ways, namely: blocking all traffic from a certain countries until a defense mechanism is made. Another way is to block them certain IP addresses. The third way and perhaps the safest is to buy some kind of DDoS protection (Cloudflare is popular).",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"If the user sets a weak password with few digits, it can be quite difficult for the attacker simply to log into the user account. For example there is a brute force method which it tries all possible combinations depending on the number of digits in the code. Also every page today offers the option ""Forgot your password?"" where we can respond to some secret question, for example, ""In which city were you born?"". This is where ""dictionary attack"" comes in handy. where a text file with a list of all cities in Croatia is used and in that way answer correctly in a few seconds and set the password again.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Ethical"
"SQL security vulnerability of a web application where an attacker tries to use the application code to access or damage the database. If successful, it enables the attacker creating, reading, updating, modifying or deleting data stored in the database. ",Technical,"Technical, Business, Ethical"
"SQL injection is one of the most common types of web application security vulnerabilities. SQL injection usually occurs when the user is prompted for input (eg username), a instead of a name, the user provides an SQL statement that will unknowingly be run in the database.",Technical,"Technical, Ethical"
"Some tools that test web application vulnerabilities are: Nikto, Wapiti, Pentest-Tools, etc. There are also some tools in Kali Linux for testing web applications, namely: nmap (for server status detection), WackoPicko (for testing source code), DirBuster (for finding files and directories on a web server) etc.",Technical,Technical
"The word private indicates that these are resources that are reserved only for us. Memory, processing power and data are not shared with other users. In this case, ""virtual"" means that it is a partition on a physical server, which is dedicated to you. ",Technical,"Technical, Business"
VPS hosting is cheaper than a full dedicated hosting plan that uses a physical server.,Economic,"Technical, Economic"
"Many VPS plans can be customized as needed, so you pay for what you want, but don't have to deal with any features you'll never need.",Economic,"Business, Economic, Technical"
"Although resources are still shared, as with the time-sharing model, virtualization provides a higher level of security, depending on the type of virtualization used, because individual virtual servers are largely isolated from each other and can run their own full-fledged operating systems that can be independently restarted as virtual instance.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"It is used to reduce hardware costs by condensing failover clusters onto a single machine, which dramatically reduces costs while providing the same services.",Economic,"Technical, Economic, Business"
"It is necessary to test new programs in an independent server environment. Dedicated servers are often too expensive for sporadic use. Instead, users prefer a VPS environment. They are cheap enough to have on hand and flexible enough to test any application.",Economic,"Technical, Economic, Business"
"When you store and share large or complex files, sometimes it's best to store them virtually so as not to burden your regular systems. A VPS is the perfect solution for storing large files while keeping them available when needed.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"As one of the most popular reasons for VPS hosting, VPNs are easy to create, use, and even resell to other users. VPN users prefer virtual private servers because they are cheap and secure.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"Virtual private servers are also used as a proxy to hide the user's IP address. In this way, VPS clients add an extra layer of security between their local computer and the servers they access.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Ethical"
VPS solutions are great for making copies of web pages and files that you make changes to or that might get damaged at some point. ,Technical,"Technical, Business"
"Basically you can use a VPS for anything you would use a dedicated server for; however, keep in mind that you'll get less overall storage and bandwidth. If you don't need an entire dedicated server, VPS is a more affordable choice because you'll only pay for what you need.",Economic,"Technical, Economic"
"The advantage of VPS is that you don't have to worry about hardware management - so you don't need to monitor the status of hard drives, RAM and CPU. They are adapted to host most types of web projects of moderate dimensions.",Technical,"Technical, Business"
"VPS hosting isn't as cheap as shared hosting, but it's cheaper than dedicated hosting because you only pay for what you need. VPS delivers great value for money",Economic,"Technical, Economic"
Reliable performance-You have your own allocated bandwidth and storage and don't have to share it with other companies,Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"Control-You get SSH and root access to your environment, giving you more control.",Technical,"Technical, Business"
"Less powerful than dedicated servers. A VPS server can be perfect for personal websites or for heavy programs, but if you plan to run a huge business portal with a huge forum section, that will send tons of emails every day, and that will run all the resource-hungry programs at the same time, you will need a dedicated machine",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"Requires more technical knowledge. Unlike a cloud web hosting account, a VPS server will require more technical knowledge to manage and maintain.",Technical,"Technical, Business"
"At its simplest level, virtualization allows you to virtually and cost-effectively have two or more computers with two or more completely different environments on a single piece of hardware.",Technical,"Technical, Economic"
"Adequate installations in the space are required, such as power and network cables, which must be assembled according to special rules in order to avoid operational errors.",Technical,"Technical, Business"
The cooling system is also important and must be properly arranged.,Technical,"Technical, Business"
All this requires people with certain knowledge who will prepare the place for the servers and finally install them,Technical,"Technical, Business"
"servers must be maintained, new updates installed, repaired or backed up",Technical,"Technical, Business"
"The system is scalable and can become very large. The bigger the system, the more engineers are needed for maintenance and customer support. A system can become so large that it contains multiple teams such as a team of people for marketing, operations, maintenance, customer support, etc. As the system expands, more resources and
engineers are needed.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
"In the future, the system could be evaluated so that the main server is upgraded with resources, and it could be expanded to even more virtual private servers, or more resources would be assigned to them. Let's say that we assign more resources to vps1, then vps1 can host more websites, support larger ones or the like, depending on what kind of upgrade is being done. During the evolution of the system, they could encounter challenges such as a greater number of traffic, i.e. interest in the product and more work related to its management.",Technical,"Technical, Business, Economic"
